# Travel Form Web

* Sponsor USA Trip Travel Form

* This README file provides information on the travel form website created by Darshil, which is used to sponsor individuals for a trip to the United States. The website is made in PHP and saves all of the data that is filled out by participants in a MySQL database.

## The Sponsor USA Trip Travel Form is a simple but effective website that demonstrates Darshil's PHP and MySQL skills. The website is easy to use and allows participants to easily submit their information for consideration for sponsorship.


## Appendix

To use the website, simply visit the following URL:

## [website URL]

* On the main page of the website, you will see a form where you can enter your name, age, gender, email, phone number, and any doubts that you have about the trip. Once you have filled out the form, click on the "Submit" button.

* Your information will be saved to the MySQL database and Darshil will review it to determine if you are eligible to be sponsored for the trip. If you are selected, Darshil will contact you to provide you with more information.

* PHP Skill Highlight

  One of the key features of the website is that it demonstrates Darshil's PHP skills. The website uses PHP to connect to the MySQL database, validate the data that is entered by participants, and send emails to Darshil when new participants submit their information.

* MySQL Database

  The website uses a MySQL database to store all of the data that is filled out by participants. The database contains a table called travel_form which stores the following information for each participant:

    Name 

    Age

    Gender

    Email

    Phone 

    number

    Doubt

* Darshil can use the MySQL database to view all of the participants who have submitted their information, as well as to filter the data by specific criteria.
